TryToCord
=========

> I can't switch to Velocity. Here is a maintained fork of Waterfall.

Why did I create this fork? Because Waterfall is not maintained anymore. Let's create a nice fork because why not?

TryToCord focuses on three main areas:

- **Stability**: TryToCord aims to be stable. We will achieve this by making the codebase testable and discouraging practices that lead to proxy lag.
- **Features**: TryToCord aims to include more features than canonical BungeeCord.
- **Scalability**: TryToCord should be able to handle a large number of concurrent players, given a reasonably modern CPU, memory, and good network connection.

## How To (Server Admins)

Download a copy of `trytocord.jar` from the Releases tab.

TryToCord requires **Java 8** or above (we recommend at least Java 17).

## How To (Plugin Developers)

This proxy is a fork of Waterfall. Check Waterfall's official websites/wiki; Waterfall/BungeeCord plugins will work on TryToCord.
